# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project involves building a classifier model using Naive Bayes and Random Forest for the Credit Card Fraud Detection process. The following steps were undertaken during the development of this project:

## 1. Data Ingestion
The data was ingested from a GitHub repository. This is the first step where we load the data for our project.

## 2. Data Cleaning
In this step, the data was cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and any incorrect data entries.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to make it suitable for model building. This involved steps like feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## 4. Model Building
Two models were built for this project - Naive Bayes and Random Forest. These models were trained on the training data.

## 5. Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using appropriate metrics. This helped in understanding how well the models were performing.

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters of the models were tuned to improve their performance. This was done using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.

## 7. Choosing the Best Parameters for a Model
The best parameters for each model were chosen based on the results of hyperparameter tuning.

## 8. Choosing the Best Model
Finally, the best model between Naive Bayes and Random Forest was chosen based on their performance.

These steps helped in building a robust Credit Card Fraud Detection system.
